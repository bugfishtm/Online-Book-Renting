# PHP Library Folder

The `_lib` folder is a critical component of SuitefishCMS. It contains library files that provide essential functionalities and utilities required by the CMS during its operation.

Files in this folder that follow the naming pattern `lib.*.php` will be automatically included during the site startup, prior to the initialization phase. This ensures that necessary libraries are available for the CMS right from the beginning.

Inside the official documentation you can find variables which are available with information for your module and site development!
