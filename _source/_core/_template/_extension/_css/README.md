# CSS Folder

The `_css` folder is designated for storing CSS files that are automatically loaded into Suitefish via the HTML include at `/core/stylesheet.php`. This folder helps manage CSS code required for various styling needs.

The typical files you might find in this folder include:
- **CSS Files**: Containing styles relevant to the CMS functionalities.
- **PHP Files**: These can also be used to include PHP code, with settings and initializations already handled at file load-up.

CSS files in this folder are auto-loaded if file name is starting with css.*

Inside the official documentation you can find variables which are available with information for your module and site development!
